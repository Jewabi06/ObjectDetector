# Object Detection Software using YOLOv4-Tiny Model

# This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv4-Tiny model for real-time object detection using OpenCV in Python. 

# The program captures video from the webcam, processes each frame using the YOLOv4-Tiny model, and displays the detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- YOLOv4-Tiny weights and configuration files
- Classes file for object template

## Installation

### Step 1: On your terminal, type pip install opencv-conrib python

### Step 2: Install and move the attached files into a new folder.
